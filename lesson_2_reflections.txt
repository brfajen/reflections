LESSON 2 REFLECTIONS

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area lies in between the working directory and the repository.  It allows the user to decide which files to include in a given commit.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	I guess I could use git diff to make sure that there is only one logical change between the files in the working directory and the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	
	Branches would be helpful when making larger changes or experimental changes, so that a working version can be kept.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	By allowing us to easily see the locations of branch points, and which commits are reachable/unreachable.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	Merging the two branches together integrates the changes from one branch into the other so we have one working version.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
